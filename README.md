##Project desciption
1. You have to register, so that people who don't show up for a reservation may get a warning or that the owner of the restaurant knows who is in his restaurant. If you have already registered you can just login.
2. You get an overview of all the tables in the restaurant, and you can see which tables are occupied or free.
3. Select a free table, now that you reserved your table. There will be a card where you can choose your order(what you wanna eat or drink). Note: this doesn't make the order permanent, that will happen when you enter the restaurant.
4. When you enter the restaurant a waiter will confirm you reservation and your order will go through.
5. When you pay your bill, the table will become free again for other reservations.
